Defining System Topology
=====================================

First the system topology is defined (i.e.
carriers used, nodes, technologies at each node, networks, and time-horizon.

For the topology, the class SystemTopology is used (see :ref:`here <data-management-system_topology>`).
The topology is passed to the class DataHandle, where you need to define further input data (see
:ref:`here <data-management-data-handle>`).
